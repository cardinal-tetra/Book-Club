We love books because they inspire, entertain, and educate us.

The Book Club is an application built using Rails for voracious readers to log on via Facebook and recommend their favourite works through Google Books.

Users can follow the recommendations of their fellow readers, post their thoughts, and browse the membership and interests of the entire readership.
